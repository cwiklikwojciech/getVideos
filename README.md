# GetVideos

GetVideos is a React Application to creating your own libraries.

## Get the Code

Use

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cwiklikwojciech/getVideos.git
$ cd getVideos
$ npm install
//run the app
```

## How it works ?

The application is designed to store the user's favorite videos within the site.

Videos are listed with data such as
* ● number of plays
* ● number of likes
* ● name of the movie
* ● movie thumbnail
* ● date of adding to the library
Actions such as:
* ● watch (also after clicking on the thumbnail, the movie then opens in the modal)
* ● delete
* ● add to favorites

The list of films has:
* ● pagination
* ● possibility to choose the type of display (tiles or a list)
* ● ability to clear all videos
* ● the ability to upload a demo of films (that is, to load a database of films about
IDs hardcoded in the application)
* ● the "favorites only" filter - showing only your favorite movies
* ● sort by oldest / last added
